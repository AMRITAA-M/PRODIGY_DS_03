# PRODIGY_DS_03

Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

This project was completed as part of Task 3 during my Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. The objective was to build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer would purchase a product or service using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. I performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset, followed by model training and evaluation. The analysis focused on key demographic and behavioral attributes such as age, job, marital status, education, and previous interactions with the company. This project helped me strengthen my skills in machine learning, model interpretation, and customer behavior analysis, while also providing valuable insights that can support targeted marketing strategies.
